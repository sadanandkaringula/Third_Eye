# Third_Eye
# Introduction
Third eye for blinds is an innovation which helps the blinds  people to navigate with speed and confidence  by detecting the  nearby obstacles using the help of  ultrasonic waves and  notify them with buzzer sound or  vibration. They only need  to wear this device as a band or  cloth. The intensity of Vibration and rate of beeping increases with decrease in distance and this is a fully automated device.

# Purpose
->According to World Health Organization (WHO) 42  million peoples are estimated as blinds worldwide. 

->So, the aim of the project is to develop a cheap and  more  efficient way to help visually impaired to navigate with  greater comfort, speed and confidence.
# Current Feature
The features of Third eye for blind people: By wearing  this device they can fully avoid the use of white cane  and such other devices. This devices will help the blind  to navigate without holding a stick which is a bit  annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a cap (or) band  and it can function very accurately and they only need a  very little training to use it.
# Components used are
-> Arduino UNO

# Advantages
->Low design time

->Low production cost.

->This system is applicable for both the indoor and  outdoor environment.

->It is dynamic system.

->Less space.

->Less power consumption

# Limitations
->This project only used for blind people, who get affected  in their daily life problems. Limitations of this project is  that it only notifies with buzzer.

->Small (or) very tiny sharp objects or things canâ€™t be measured.
# Conclusion
->The main purpose of this study is to produce a prototype  that can detect objects or obstacles in front of users and  give warning (or) alerts to the user in the form of  vibrations.

->By using this device blind people can travel to anywhere without any problems as it can facilitate the faster movement and increase in safety for the blind people
